	abstract = {Compact gamma cameras with a square-shaped monolithic scintillator crystal and an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are actively being developed for applications in areas such as small animal imaging, cancer diagnostics and radiotracer guided surgery. Statistical methods of position reconstruction, which are potentially superior to the traditional centroid method, require accurate knowledge of the spatial response of each photomultiplier. Using both Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data obtained with a camera prototype, we show that the spatial response of all photomultipliers (light response functions) can be parameterized with axially symmetric functions obtained iteratively from flood field irradiation data. The study was performed with a camera prototype equipped with a 30  ×  30  ×  2 mm3 LYSO crystal and an 8  ×  8 array of SiPMs for 140 keV gamma rays. The simulations demonstrate that the images, reconstructed with the maximum likelihood method using the response obtained with the iterative approach, exhibit only minor distortions: the average difference between the reconstructed and the true positions in X and Y directions does not exceed 0.2 mm in the central area of 22  ×  22 mm2 and 0.4 mm at the periphery of the camera. A similar level of image distortions is shown experimentally with the camera prototype.}

	title = {Monte Carlo Calculations in Nuclear Medicine: Applications in Diagnostic Imaging},
	journal = {Physiological Measurement},
	abstract = {The book seems to be useful as an answer to how and where to begin with applications of Monte Carlo calculations in nuclear medicine imaging. 
 It includes basic principles of gamma cameras (SPECT and PET), but basic principles of Monte Carlo calculations are presented just for physicist; physicians interested in the field must find adequate references. From the other side, the basics of nuclear medicine instrumentation are given with plenty of physical insight. 
 The majority of the chapters are written with a clear, uniform level; they are well linked, and the editors' work is evident. 
 Authors demonstrate how efficient Monte Carlo simulation packages have allowed the study of scatter for more realistic activity distributions and attenuation maps, and according to a variety of physical parameters. Some of the packages commented on are: 
 (1) SIMSET. For SPECT and PET. PET collimators simulation based on the PETSIM code. This program is under continuous development to include improvements in several physical effects and simulation of SPECT collimators and detectors. 
 (2) MCMATV3D. A vectorized Monte Carlo code for phantom transport in heterogeneous media. Useful, for example, to study nonuniform attenuation compensation for simulated SPECT studies and to evaluate scatter subtraction methods in nonuniform media. 
 (3) SIMSPECT. This validated code models tomographic imaging from nonuniform, asymmetric radionuclide source geometries. Can be used to investigate collimator geometric response including cone beam; positron emitters in SPECT can also be modelled with SIMSPECT. The code is suited to examining different collimator designs (materials and dimensions) and considering `contamination' of images by higher energy photons. 
 (4) SIMIND. This program simulates clinical SPECT cameras including different types of detector parameters and has the capability to simulate transmission sources. Research works performed with SIMIND are commented on: comparison of different scatter corrections techniques, multiple windows scatter correction methods, high-count-rate detector response, transmission SPECT, downscatter and properties of collimators. 
 Even if some important applications, such as the evaluation of iterative reconstruction scatter compensation, deserve more space, the authors show that Monte Carlo simulation is valuable for development, testing and comparison of scatter correction models in nuclear medicine tomographic imaging. 
 The problem of image quality degradation when imaging a radionuclide with multiple emissions (111-In, 123-I, 67-Ga), or when acquiring simultaneous dual isotope images, is considered in relation to the design of specific collimators. A Monte Carlo simulation of photon transport that accounts for penetration of and scatter in the collimator is discussed. One of the codes presented to face this problem has been adapted for use with the SIMIND Monte Carlo code. Another one combines a theoretical, Bayesian observer model with the Monte Carlo numerical tool. 
 It would be useful to know how and which of the analysed Monte Carlo methods and results are (or could be) applied in multiple head detector commercial systems. One always tries to recognize reconstructed artefacts in relation to attenuation and scatter corrections methods applied by different brands and models. 
 The Monte Carlo tool could be an economical way to initiate technological developments of, for example, collimators or crystal design and materials or detectors geometries. 
 Monte Carlo is presented as a useful method both for evaluating existing PET scanners and in designing new ones. The Monte Carlo technique is also applied to scatter correction for quantitative 3D-PET. Simulations of a wide variety of count rates and source distributions are essential to manufacturers, and it is shown how Monte Carlo could be a way to evaluate the performance of PET systems under such conditions. The presented program PETSIM includes independent programs for activity distribution, collimator and detector array. The results obtained are useful in designing block detectors and PET geometries for new systems.}

abstract = "There is a need for mathematical modelling for the evaluation of important parameters for photon imaging systems. A Monte Carlo program which simulates medical imaging nuclear detectors has been developed. Different materials can be chosen for the detector, a cover and a phantom. Cylindrical, spherical, rectangular and more complex phantom and source shapes can be simulated. Photoelectric, incoherent, coherent interactions and pair production are simulated. Different detector parameters, e.g. the energy pulse-height distribution and pulse pile-up due to finite decay time of the scintillation light emission, can be calculated. An energy resolution of the system is simulated by convolving the energy imparted with an energy-dependent Gaussian function. An image matrix of the centroid of the events in the detector can be simulated. Simulation of different collimators permits studies on spatial resolution and sensitivyt. Comparisons of our results with experimental data and other published results have shown good agreement. The usefulness of the Monte Carlo code for the accurately simulation of important parameters in scintillation camera systems, stationary as well as SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) systems, has been demonstrated."

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {Accurate quantification in PET and SPECT requires correction for a number of physical factors, such as photon attenuation, Compton scattering and random coincidences (in PET). Another factor affecting quantification is the limited spatial resolution. While considerable effort has gone into development of routine correction techniques for the former factors, less attention has been paid to the latter. Spatial resolution-related effects, referred to as ‘partial volume effects’ (PVEs), depend not only on the characteristics of the imaging system but also on the object and activity distribution. Spatial and/or temporal variations in PVE can often be confounding factors. Partial volume correction (PVC) could in theory be achieved by some kind of inverse filtering technique, reversing the effect of the system PSF. However, these methods are limited, and usually lead to noise-amplification or image artefacts. Some form of regularization is therefore needed, and this can be achieved using information from co-registered anatomical images, such as CT or MRI. The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding of PVEs and to review possible approaches for PVC. We also present a review of clinical applications of PVC within the fields of neurology, cardiology and oncology, including specific examples.}

abstract = "Early in the history of nuclear medicine imaging it was realized that the nature of physiological mechanisms associated with the use of radiotracers prevented the identification of anatomic structures with a high degree of accuracy. This limitation often created difficulties in accurate interpretations of acquired images and caused investigators to seek methods of obtaining accurate anatomic correlations. Initial work centered on the use of software tools to combine anatomic and physiological data. Limitations in the use of these techniques, coupled with the development and refinements of anatomic imaging technologies (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), resulted in the development of hybrid imaging systems that combined CT with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). With these hybrid systems, the images can be viewed separately or combined in a fused presentation for direct image correlation of anatomy and physiology. Presently, SPECT systems are available either with nondiagnostic CT capability for attenuation correction and image correlation, or with fully diagnostic CT capability, providing complementary diagnostic information. Equivalently, PET systems with diagnostic CT capability that provide high-resolution physiological and anatomic images are also now commercially available. These systems continue to evolve with the development of new detector materials and data acquisition and image processing technology. The widespread use of SPECT in cardiac imaging has resulted in the development of several new approaches to data acquisition and these new systems currently have either CT capability or the addition of this technology is planned in the future. The development and commercial availability of hybrid imaging systems has provided physicians with important new tools that significantly improve the diagnostic, staging, and treatment planning processes that are now available for their use."
