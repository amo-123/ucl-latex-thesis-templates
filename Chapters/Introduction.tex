\section{Multi-modal Imaging and INSERT}
In the last twenty years the clinical use of multi-modal imaging techniques has increased \cite{PATTON2009247}. A multi-modal imaging system involves the simultaneous or sequential acquisition of two medical imaging techniques from a single combined instrument. Such techniques allow the clinicians to collect structural and functional information from a patient, providing more diagnostic information. The dual acquisition also has advantages when registering two images as the topology is conserved across the two scans. The ability to capture two images at the same time also reduces the number of scans required per patient, it is for these reasons that multi-modal imaging has become so widely used.
\paragraph{}
However these techniques have their drawbacks. The use of ionising radiation in techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) together will increase the dose received by the patient. Using two imaging devices simultaneously also presents some physical issues, dependent on the type of imaging technique. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) along side Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or SPECT poses a compatibility issue as the strong magnetic fields required for MRI interfere with photomultiplier tubes (PMT) used in PET and SPECT ,\cite{PICHLER2008199}. However, in the last ten years the use of MRI compatible PET and SPECT systems have been increasingly developed, this is due to the development of the MR compatible readout devices, such as the Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM), to replace the PMT \cite{MCELROY2007106}. 
\paragraph{}
This thesis focuses on the development of the first clinical simultaneous SPECT/MRI imaging system. Though SPECT/MRI systems have proven successful in pre-clinical use, \cite{0031-9155-55-6-002}, there have been many challenges when developing a clinical system \cite{doi:10.1259/bjr.20160690}. The `Integrated SPECT/MRI for Enhanced stratification in Radio-chemo Therapy (INSERT)' project is the first to successfully produce a clinical SPECT/MRI system as seen in figure \ref{fig:INSERT}. The project has made use of the developments in SiPM and a novel collimator design \cite{7430864} to produce a SPECT insert module which can be integrated with an existing MRI machine to allow simultaneous imaging of the brain.

\section{Objectives}
The INSERT project promises to lay the ground work for a full body SPECT/MRI system. Such a system holds many advantages over PET/MRI, as SPECT is the more widely used and can image at a larger range of radioisotopes \cite{doi:10.1177/153303460600500406}. However to further the development of INSERT, thorough testing must be carried out to ensure it is ready for clinical use. The focus of this thesis is to evaluate the potential performance of the INSERT design for different radionuclide, with a focus on the impact of septal penetration and depth of interaction (DOI). The INSERT system has been constructed in a simulated environment using Monte Carlo software \cite{1236960}. The system was tested by running experiments in the simulation. The simulated experiment allows the source and scanner properties to be defined. The novel collimator has been simulated and the experiments focus on testing its robustness over a range of energies. Recording the interactions within the scanner will determine how effectively the collimator is able to direct photons without degrading image quality.
\paragraph{} 
The quality of the images can be reduced if the system is susceptible to septal penetration. This is the penetration of photons through the collimator's septa, causing an degradation in the collimator resolution \cite{0031-9155-18-6-005}, \cite{0031-9155-50-21-004}. Septal penetration was measured by carrying out experiments with various phantom types and measuring the effects of high energy photons on the resulting data in order to model the extent of penetration in the collimator. The DOI determines how far the photons travels through the scintillation crystal before it interacts \cite{0031-9155-55-2-N04}. The DOI is required when reconstructing the images acquired from the scan. Accurately predicting the DOI improves the performance of the image reconstruction algorithm. The interaction data recorded from the experiments allows the penetration and DOI to be estimated. Moreover the reconstructed images from the experiment allows the impact of these phenomena to be realised in the final images.

\section{Motivation}
The development of a SPECT/MRI will provide many advantages due to the diverse applications that SPECT imaging provides. The use of PET/MRI is limited to a single radionuclide energy. SPECT is widely used as a range of radionuclide energies can be used for dual-radionuclide imaging. The use of simultaneous SPECT/MRI aims to improve treatment for brain tumours and radiotherapy planning \cite{doi:10.1259/bjr.20160690}. The combined modalities reduces the number of scans a patient will have and so provides a more comfortable treatment. The INSERT aims to determine functional information from scans of known tumours in order to track development and plan treatments. Due to the novel design of the SPECT insert, it is essential that the component properties are analysed and the system is tested and classified. It is important to test the fundamental principles governing the system and determine how the device will respond in use.
\paragraph{}
In order to carry out thorough testing the SPECT, insert was constructed in a Monte Carlo simulation. This simulated environment allowed for complete control of the system and the experimental design. The testing carried out can record all interaction with the scanner, providing information that cannot be achieved easily through the physical scanner. The simulations allows for safer and cheaper testing of the scanner design. The experiments are diverse and easily changed, the scanner design can also be changed between experiments. The flexibility of the simulated experiments provides many advantages over testing the physical system. The results from the simulations can help define a quantified model used to aid future testing and system design improvements. Accounting for septal penetration and DOI in the physical scanner requires the development of a model for these phenomena that will predict its impact, the Monte Carlo experiment can be used to test these models.
