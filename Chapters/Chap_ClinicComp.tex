Milan experiments revealed need for a smoother system and so a trolley was designed for the use of the scanner to aid loading. The uniformity flood was not carried out daily due to weight constraints which are not overcome with this design. 

\section{Introduction}
The final goal of this project is to establish clinical use of the first simultaneous \acrshort{SPECT} MRI system. In order to achieve this we must determine how the INSERT compares to existing SPECT systems and how the combination of SPECT and MR data can provide superior clinical information. 
\section{Methods}
The INSERT has been tested with a number of phantoms; to test the systems imaging capabilities against a standard clinical SPECT a complex phantom was used. An Aldersson Phantom was filled with ... $^{99m}Tc$ and scanned in several position in the INSERT system. The phantom scan was repeated in a ... clinical SPECT system.
