The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the performance of a novel \acrshort{SPECT} system, designed for simultaneous use within a clinical \acrshort{MRI}. The scanner known as the \acrshort{INSERT} is the first clinical system of its kind, developed to provide improved tumour treatment stratification and establish the ground work for clinical \acrshort{SPECT/MRI}. The scanner imaging performance has not been fully evaluated; in this work we have acquired and reconstructed the first images on the novel system. Calibration and acquisition protocols have been implemented and assessed here to establish the clinical feasibility of the system. The image reconstruction procedures were implemented on the first phantom images in order to assess the system's imaging capabilities. This thesis tackled issues involving detector instability, causing incomplete data sets and pixel failure in the prototype detector system. A study on the system's stability established the need for new calibration protocols and software. The development of this software aims to provide a multifaceted tool to carry out successful acquisitions on this \acrshort{INSERT}. A result of the first extensive use of the system a number of acquisition protocols and reconstruction methods were developed.  This work laid the ground work for the first use of the complete system which utilises the capabilities of both \acrshort{SPECT} and \acrshort{MRI}. Following this study we aim to implement the \acrshort{INSERT} within an \acrshort{MRI} and establish its use as a complete clinical system.
